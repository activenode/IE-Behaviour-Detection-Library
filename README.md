# IE Behaviour Detection Library
This is a library that allows to be able to check which version of Internet Explorer with which document version / standards version is present.

This library is provided as conditional comments are not sufficient anymore. 
E.g. when a user sets up the Internet Explorer to be run at Version 10 with the Doc-Version of IE9 you can neither use IE10-CSS-Hacks nor IE9 Conditional Comments - a dilemma.
This library provides a very new and simple way to check for both versions!
